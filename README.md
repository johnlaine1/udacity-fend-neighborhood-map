#### Created by: John Laine

A project created and submitted as part of the Udacity Front End Developer course.
Upon starting the app, a Google map will be displayed with a number of
pre-set map markers. There is a slide out drawer on the left with a searchable
list of these markers. When a marker of list item is selected, additional information
will appear in an info window above the selected map marker.

## Running the Application

2. Be sure to have both npm and bower installed on your machine and then from the command line run `npm install && bower install` to install needed packages.
